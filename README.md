# Lyrics! A fun little project to help me and the wife learn rap songs

Lyrics videos on youtube suck, and they get millions of views.

They don't need a flashy 5 second intro, and they don't need a pretty picture of a grrrl in the background. What they need is a visual way to communicate what syllable is sung (rapped) at what time in the piece.

The bouncing ball also sucks. Bouncing balls only tell you about the mistakes you've made. By the time the ball has bounced, you've already missed your entrance. Plus, you have to keep you eyes glued to the screen the whole time.

Music notation is great, but too much. People are scared of it. Looks like calculus or something.

So letter spacing.

> That would take forever!!

Hence the project.

Here's the flow I imagine

* Copy a paste the lyric block into a textarea.
* Rearrange the lyrics so that it actually matches what's sung (repeat each chorus, etc)
* Break the lyrics out into "single screen" chunks
* Break the single screen chunks into syllables
* Download the music from youtube or something
* Break out each single screen into a single aud file (in audacity or something)
* Upload and connect each screen with each aud file
* Manually tap the space bar while the audio file plays to indicate when to sing what
* Save that as a JSON obj
* Front end to come up with a pretty way of spacing or coloring or whatever... I can figure that out better once I have the data.


Simple right?
